# Heather-Casdin
A horizon patch for the Heather Casdin companion

The changes listed below aim to bring Heather in line with how Horizon handles companions, crafting and loot in general.

* Changed the sink to say Dirty Water in both her Bunker and FH Bathroom
* Added sorting tags to all items, weapons, armour/clothing, ingestible's etc... and changed them to be more in line with Horizon equivalents, and added perks to the weapon attachments.
* Changed the recipes of Constructible objects, and the workbench they are crafted in (they now use Heather's custom workbench with Horizon submenus)
* Edited all containers to reduce clutter, and edited Heather's robot storage as well as cell edits.
* Changed Heather's base Barter caps to 500 (can still be changed via Heather's Console)
* Edited leveled lists to reduce or restrict distribution of items, and made Misc items Unique to Heather only
* Removed some perks and changed others, and added Horizon perks to Heather, making her stealth be affected by her actions.
* Edited Heather's spells to mirror the perks they are linked with
* Edited display text assigned to perk conditions to accurately display the correct information.
